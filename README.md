<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pecan-quickstart is to document the most minimal instructions to get up and running with PEcAn using R (not the web interface).

## repo structure (all subject to change)

- `README.md`: (you are here) this will eventually include the simplest, most universal installation instructions possible (we hope)
- `templates/`: annotated template pecan.xml files and workflow scripts
- `vignettes/`: minimal reproducible examples for a few different kinds of PEcAn runs
